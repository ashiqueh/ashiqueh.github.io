				<h4>LI-Buddy</a> </h4>
				<p> This is a program which finds me leads and generates page views for me on a certain social networking site. Built with Python, Redis, and Selenium. Ask me about it!
				</p>

					<h4> <a href="https://libuddy.herokuapp.com/">Discount Finder</a> </h4>
					<p> This is a web application which finds discount codes for brands via social media. The app is written in Python (Django) and uses the Twitter and Instagram APIs, as well as BS4 to search through posts and extract codes.
					</p>
						<p> A lot of bloggers post discount codes they get from brand partnerships on their social media. I do a lot of online shopping, so I thought it would be useful to have a way to get these discount codes without having to search through posts by hand. Et viola, Discount Finder was born.</p>

					<h4><a href="https://www.github.com/ashiqueh/ig-downloader/">Instagram Downloader</a></h4>
					<p> This is a python program that downloads all of your instagram photos (in full resolution) for you. I originally made it to backup some older pictures before deleting them. Source is available on GitHub! </p>
					</p>

						<h4> Dental Records </h4>
						<p>
							 I built this application for McGill's Faculty of Dentistry in 2015. Made with Java, Swing, and MySQL. It is a full dental records system which also suggests possible treatments based on clinical data and the patient's history. 
					</p>

					<h4> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ashiqueh.getrelief">Get Relief</a> </h4>
					<p> This is an Android application I also built with the Faculty of Dentistry. The app helps cancer patients manage their symptoms and treatment by keeping track of their issues, suggesting treatments, and following up with the patient. A prototype is available on the Play Store.
